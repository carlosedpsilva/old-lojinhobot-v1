# LojinhoBot (this version is discontinued)
A Java bot for [Discord](https://discord.com/) using [JDA by DV8FromTheWorld and MinnDevelopment](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA).

Discontinued experimental version of the Project developed for the 'Applied Project IV' discipline of the FACENS Computer Engineering course in the second half of 2020.
For this repository, experimental changes that would become part of the Official Project would be committed, however it was discontinued and no commit was made anymore.
**A rewrite of the Official Project is being made [here](https://github.com/lojinho/LojinhoBot.git)**.

Once the rewrite of the official project reaches version 1.0.0 of production, this repository will be deleted.

# Introduction
The premise is to develop a Discord role enhancer system, implementing categories for roles of different types and uses to make server moderation and management more dynamic. In addition, LojinhoBot is a personal project aimed at serving the 'Lojinho' server of the Lojinheiros community.
